Critique of Design v1
The primary concern that I would have with the design is the criteria used in forming its modules. 
It seems to me that the modules of the original design are more akin to the “flowchart” approach maligned by Parnas. 
The modules are not designed to hide information from each other, and instead are steps in the randomization process.
Randex is notable, as it literaly calls each function in sequence.

Design v2
The intent behind v2 of randex is to better hide the design decisions of each module. 
The modules are as follows: 
1.Input; Design unchanged from v1, hides the function used to save the contents of the file to an array of characters. 
2.Find_Problems; design largely unchanged, the match function has been brought out into its own module 
3.Find_Answers; design largely unchanged, the match function has been brought out into its own module 
4.Match_Problems; Hides the inner workings of the match function for the problem module 
5.Match_Answers; Hides the inner workings of the match function for the answer module 
6.Rand; A fusion of the randomize function designed to hide the logic related to the randomization process.
7.Output; (Intended to be) A function that takes the randomized exam and puts it into an output file.

2 uses 1, 4
3 uses 1, 5
6 uses 2, 3
7 uses 6
